# MERN Stack Application

## Overview

This is a MERN stack application that combines Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and React.js to create a powerful web application. The frontend is styled using Tailwind CSS, and it incorporates OpenAI's DALL-E model for generating images from text input. For image storage and management, Cloudinary is used.
